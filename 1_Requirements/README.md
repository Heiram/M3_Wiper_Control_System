## Introduction
### Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be handled. The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driverâ€™s concentration during the driving. Thus, this proposed system could be a solution for this problem. The concept of this wiper system is similar with other conventional wiper, yet this system will use push buttons to control the wiper. Wiper speed, turn on and turn off of the wiper is controlled by using push buttons.
## Research
## Objectives
Wiper control system is used to control the movement of wiper. Our goal is to operate the wipers using push button like single push may switch on the wiper after that each push may increase the speed and each double push may decrease speed of the movement of wiper, long press will switch off the wiper.
