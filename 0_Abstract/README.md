# Wiper Control system
## Absract
### Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or water from the vehicle’s windscreen. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.
### Existing system manually used control stalk to activate wiper and the process of pulling up wiper is difficult to be handled. The driver needs to switch on and off the control stalk and it will reduce the driver’s concentration during the driving. Thus, this proposed system could be a solution for this problem. The concept of this wiper system is similar with other conventional wiper, yet this system will use push buttons to control the wiper. Wiper speed, turn on and turn off of the wiper is controlled by using push buttons.
